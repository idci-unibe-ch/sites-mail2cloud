# UniBE Mail2Cloud onboarding site

In this repository the offical user onboarding site for the Mail2Cloud migration is managed.

This site makes use of:

  * [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
  * [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material)
  * [Material for MkDocs Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/)

## Contributions

Everybody is invited to contribute to the documentation. If you find that certain topics are not sufficiently covered or difficult to understand, you can fork this repository, fix the respective part and then send us a pull request. Even for such small things like typos!  
Yes, really, we appreciate your effort!  
  
You can make our lives easier when you ship logically selfcontained pull requests, which means:

  * one logical change per pull request (typos or a new paragraph on topic X, another for topic Y)
  * squash multiple commits before starting the pull request

Thank you!
